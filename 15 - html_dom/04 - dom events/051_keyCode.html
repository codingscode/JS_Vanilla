             <!-- keyCode 
                The keyCode property returns the Unicode character code of the key that triggered the onkeypress event, or the 
                    Unicode key code of the key that triggered the onkeydown or onkeyup event.
                The difference between the two code types:
                Character codes - A number which represents an ASCII character
                Key codes - A number which represents an actual key on the keyboard
                These types do not always mean the same thing; for example, a lower case "w" and an upper case "W" have the same 
                    keyboard code, because the key that is pressed on the keyboard is the same (just "W" = the number "87"), but a 
                    different character code because the resulting character is different (either "w" or "W", which is "119" or "87") 
                    - See "More Examples" below to better understand it.
                Tip: To find out if the user is pressing a printable key (e.g. "a" or "5"), it is recommended to use this property on the 
                     onkeypress event. To find out if the user is pressing a function key (e.g. "F1", "CAPS LOCK" or "Home") use

                Note: In Firefox, the keyCode property does not work on the onkeypress event (will only return 0). For a 
                    cross-browser solution, use the which property together with keyCode, e.g:
                var x = event.which || event.keyCode;  // Use either which or keyCode, depending on browser support
                Tip: For a list of all Unicode characters, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.
                Tip: If you want to convert the returned Unicode value into a character, use the fromCharCode() method.
                Note: This property is read-only.
                Note: Both the keyCode and which property is provided for compatibility only. The latest version of the DOM Events 
                   Specification recommend using the key property instead (if available).
                Tip: If you want to find out whether the "ALT", "CTRL", "META" or "SHIFT" key was pressed when a key event occured, 
                   use the altKey, ctrlKey, metaKey or shiftKey property.
