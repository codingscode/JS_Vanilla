             <!-- charCode 
            The charCode property returns the Unicode character code of the key that triggered the onkeypress event.
            The Unicode character code is the number of a character (e.g. the number "97" represents the letter "a").
            Tip: For a list of all Unicode characters, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.
            Tip: If you want to convert the Unicode value into a character, use the fromCharCode() method.
            Note: If this property is used on onkeydown or onkeyup events, the returned value is always "0".
            Note: This property is read-only.
            Note: The charCode property is not supported in IE8 and earlier. However, for these browser versions, you can use the 
              keyCode propert<!DOCTYPE html>

            Note: The charCode property is not supported in IE8 and earlier. However, for these browser versions, you can use the 
              keyCode property. Or, for a cross-browser solution, you could use the following code:
            var x = event.charCode || event.keyCode; // Use either charCode or keyCode, depending on browser support
            Tip: You can also use the keyCode property to detect special keys (e.g. "caps lock" or arrow keys). However, both the 
               keyCode and charCode property is provided for compatibility only. The latest version of the DOM Events Specification 
               recommend using the key property instead (if available).
            Tip: If you want to find out whether the "ALT", "CTRL", "META" or "SHIFT" key was pressed when a key event occured, use
              the altKey, ctrlKey, metaKey or shiftKey property.
